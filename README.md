## Contributing

I made this app just for the fun of it and to learn a bit about [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and
[React](https://reactjs.org/). At the moment the functionality is very basic, and there's a lot that can
be done to make it better. If you want to contribute, please get in touch or submit a
pull request.
